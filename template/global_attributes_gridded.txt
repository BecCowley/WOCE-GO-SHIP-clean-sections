S, abstract                     = Ship-based hydrographic data are essential for physical, chemical, and biological oceanography and climate science. The data consists of more than 40 sections with multiple repeats, mostly land to land, sea surface to 10 m above the sea bottom. The data are, however, difficult to use in the archived inhomogeneous format. The purpose of this data product is to increase the value of these data by better combining, reformatting and gridding in order to facilitate their use. The product is machine readable and readily accessed by many existing visualisation and analysis software. The data processing can be repeated with modifications to suite various applications such as analysis of decadal variability of deep ocean, validation of numerical simulation output, and calibration of autonomous platforms. This initial release includes only temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen data from Conductivity-Temperature-Depth profilers, but will include other properties in the future release.
