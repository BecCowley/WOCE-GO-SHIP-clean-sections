# Notes

+ Temperature is in ITS-90. Use `t90tot68.m` for conversion to IPTS-68. The unit recorded in Matlab `Station` header (e.g. `D_pr(1).Station`) is the unit of the original CTD data, not the unit in our product.
+ Unless otherwise noted, only _good_ (as defined by `flag=2`) data are used.
+ Missing value is `-999` for ASCII and binary outputs and `NaN` otherwise.
+ Vertical coordinate is in pressure. Assuming `Depth` and/or `Corrected depth` in the Exchange CTD or SUM is in meters, we convert them to pressure. If depth is missing, we assume the bottom of measurement is 10 dbar above seabed. If `Uncorrected depth` is available but `Corrected depth` is missing, we use the former.
+ Used v3.06 of [TEOS-10](http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm) to calculate Conservative Temperature and Absolute Salinity.
+ Dissolved oxygen concentration is converted to Î¼mol/kg (micro mol per kilogram), often written `umol/kg`.
+ No horizontal interpolation is applied for stations more than 2 degrees apart.


# Gridded data

## Matlab format
Data are stored in 2 dimensional matrices as entries to a `structure`, one for each
occupation. The axes are defined in `ll_grid`
(longitude or latitude) and `pr_grid` (pressure). The structure has a field `NTime`
which is the time (in Matlab format) of the measurement at the station nearest
(in lat/lon) to the grid point.
